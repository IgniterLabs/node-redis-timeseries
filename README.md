# Node.js API for storing and querying time series in Redis

Convenient module for storing and querying time series statistics in Redis using Node.js.

The idea (and even parts of the implementation) were shamelessly stolen from the [ApiAxle](http://blog.apiaxle.com/post/storing-near-realtime-stats-in-redis/) project.

Check the contents of the `examples` folder for working examples.
